The Introduction to Applied Mathematics course offered by Harvard University is a comprehensive course designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the practical aspects of mathematics. Unlike other traditional mathematics courses that focus solely on abstract concepts, this course aims to teach students how mathematical theories are applied to solve real-world problems in fields such as economics, engineering, and physics.

## Course Structure

This course is carefully structured to ensure that students have a clear understanding of the concepts. The course is divided into two parts: 

- Part I - Building Blocks
- Part II - Applications

### Part I - Building Blocks

Part I of the course covers foundational topics that are essential for any applied mathematics course. The emphasis is on building a strong mathematical foundation to help students tackle complex real-world problems. Some of the topics covered in this part include:

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Differential Equations
- Probability Theory

### Part II - Applications

In Part II of the course, students apply the concepts learned in Part I to solve real-world problems. The course covers various applications of mathematics in different fields, including:

- Economics
- Physics
- Biology
- Engineering

## Prerequisites

This course is open to all students who have completed high school-level mathematics courses. However, to fully benefit from the course, students should have a sound understanding of the following topics:

- Algebra
- Geometry
- Trigonometry
- Calculus
