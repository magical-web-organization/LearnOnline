Bayesian statistics is a branch of statistics used to update probabilities of hypothesis and events based on new data. It involves the use of Bayes’ theorem, which is a mathematical formula that helps to calculate the probability of a hypothesis, given prior knowledge and evidence. Bayesian statistics is widely used in various fields, including physics, finance, and engineering. 

If you’re interested in learning Bayesian statistics, the Coursera platform offers an online course called “Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis.” This article provides an overview of the course, including its contents, prerequisites, duration, instructors and the benefits of studying it.

## Course Contents 

This course is designed for people with a keen interest in statistics and probability. The course covers the following topics:

- Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics
- Bayesian Inference
- The Bayesian Network Structure for Causal Inference
- Bayesian Data Analysis and Model Selection
- Bayesian Machine Learning

## Prerequisites 

To enroll in this course, you'll need to have prior knowledge of the following topics:

- Basic knowledge of calculus, including probability theory and mathematical statistics 
- Good programming skills, particularly in R or Python

## Duration 

The Bayesian Statistics course offered by Coursera takes approximately 34 hours to complete, with each week comprising four to six hours. 

## Instructors

The course is taught by three professors—Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari— who are statisticians by profession. Andrew Gelman, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, has written extensively on Bayesian data analysis, including the book “Bayesian Data Analysis.” Jennifer Hill and Aki Vehtari are also renowned statisticians in their field.

## Benefits of Studying Bayesian Statistics 

There are several benefits to studying Bayesian statistics:

- Better decision-making: With Bayesian statistics, you can update your hypothesis probabilities as new data arrives, which can help you make better decisions.
- Flexibility: Bayesian statistics is a flexible approach that can be used to solve a wide range of problems in many fields such as finance, biology, and engineering.
- Handling Uncertainty: Bayesian posteriors can handle extreme probabilities or low probabilities in uncertain situations. 

## Conclusion 

If you're interested in learning Bayesian statistics and its application, the online course offered by Coursera is an excellent starting point. You can learn from experienced statisticians and receive a globally recognized certification upon completion. This course will arm you with the right tools and knowledge to get started in the vast field of Bayesian statistics.
