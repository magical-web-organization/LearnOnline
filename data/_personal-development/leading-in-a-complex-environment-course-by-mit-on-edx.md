## Systems Thinking

One of the key skills covered in the course is systems thinking. This involves looking at complex situations as interconnected systems, rather than as isolated problems. When leaders are able to understand the larger systems at play, they can make better decisions and take more effective action.

## Communication

Effective communication is crucial in complex environments, and the course covers a variety of communication skills that leaders need to master. This includes both verbal and written communication, as well as the ability to influence and persuade others.

## Teamwork

Finally, the course covers the importance of teamwork in complex environments. Leaders learn how to build strong teams, delegate tasks effectively, and manage conflict in a way that fosters collaboration and common goals.

Throughout the course, participants have the opportunity to engage in interactive exercises and case studies, which help to reinforce the concepts covered in the course. This hands-on approach allows leaders to apply what they learn in real-world scenarios, which is essential for success in complex environments.

## Course Details

The Leading in a Complex Environment course is fully online and self-paced, so participants can work through the material at their own pace. The course is broken down into six modules, which cover the various leadership skills outlined above. Participants can expect to spend around 2-3 hours per week on the course, and there is no prerequisite knowledge required.

## Certification
