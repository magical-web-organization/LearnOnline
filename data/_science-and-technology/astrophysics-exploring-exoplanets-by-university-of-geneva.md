Astrophysics is a fascinating field of study that deals with the physical aspects of celestial objects such as stars, planets, galaxies, and the Universe as a whole. The study of astrophysics has become increasingly important over the years as we seek to understand our origins and place in the Universe. One of the most exciting areas of astrophysics today is the study of exoplanets – planets that exist outside our Solar System – and the search for extraterrestrial life.

The University of Geneva offers an online course, Astrophysics: Exploring Exoplanets, which provides a comprehensive overview of exoplanets, planet formation, and the search for extraterrestrial life. The course is designed to be accessible to a broad audience, with no prior knowledge of astrophysics required.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into eight modules, each covering a different aspect of the study of exoplanets. The modules are as follows:

1. Introduction to exoplanets
2. Planet formation
3. Detection methods
4. Exoplanet characterization
5. Atmospheres and habitability
6. The search for life
7. The future of exoplanet research
8. Conclusion

Each module consists of video lectures, readings, and quizzes to test your understanding of the material. The course also includes discussion forums, where you can share your thoughts and questions with fellow students.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of the course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of exoplanets and the search for extraterrestrial life. You will learn:

- What exoplanets are and how they are discovered
- How planets form and evolve
- The different methods used to detect exoplanets
- How to characterize exoplanets and their atmospheres
- The factors that make a planet habitable
- What we know about the search for life beyond Earth
- The current and future state of exoplanet research
