Quantum Chemistry, a branch of chemistry that applies quantum mechanics to chemical systems, has revolutionized the study of chemical reactions and their mechanisms. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign offers a comprehensive course on Quantum Chemistry that provides an in-depth understanding of the subject to the students. 

## Course Details

The course is divided into two parts: **Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics** and **Quantum Chemistry**. The Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics section provides a rigorous introduction to the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, including wave functions, operators, and observables, and their applications to hydrogen and many-electron atoms.

In the Quantum Chemistry section, the course covers the applications of quantum mechanics to molecular systems such as diatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules. The course also covers topics such as molecular orbitals, spectroscopy, and chemical reactivity.

## Course Format

The course is offered online and is self-paced, allowing students to complete the coursework at their own pace. The course includes video lectures, interactive simulations, and problem sets. 

## Faculty

The course is taught by leading faculty members from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois. The faculty includes Professor Martin Gruebele, who has received several awards for his contributions to the field of chemistry, and Professor Liviu Mirica, whose research focuses on computer simulations of biological systems.

## Enrollment

The course is open for enrollment to both undergraduate and graduate students. It is ideal for students pursuing a degree in chemistry, physics, or related fields. The course also serves as an excellent introduction to quantum chemistry for researchers and professionals in the field.
